# Exercise 1
Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiples of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included).

# Exercise 2
Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 and 50.
Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....
Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
Expected Output : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

# Exercise 3
Write a Python program that iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of three and five, print "FizzBuzz".
Sample Output :
fizzbuzz
1
2
fizz
4
buzz

# Exercise 4
Write a Python program to calculate a dog's age in dog years.
Note: For the first two years, a dog year is equal to 10.5 human years. After that, each dog year equals 4 human years.
Expected Output:

Input a dog's age in human years: 15                                    
The dog's age in dog's years is 73

# Exercise 5
Write a Python program to sum two integers. However, if the sum is between 15 and 20 it will return 20.

# Exercise 6
Write a Python program to check if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
Note :
An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal.
A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides.
An isosceles triangle is a triangle with (at least) two equal sides.
Expected Output:

Input lengths of the triangle sides:                                    
x: 6                                                                    
y: 8                                                                    
z: 12                                                                   
Scalene triangle 

# Exercise 7
Write a Python program to create the multiplication table (from 1 to 10) of a number.
Expected Output:

Input a number: 6                                                       
6 x 1 = 6                                                               
6 x 2 = 12                                                              
6 x 3 = 18                                                              
6 x 4 = 24                                                              
6 x 5 = 30                                                              
6 x 6 = 36                                                              
6 x 7 = 42                                                              
6 x 8 = 48                                                              
6 x 9 = 54                                                              
6 x 10 = 60
